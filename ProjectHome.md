# Decaf is no longer being supported by CDay. I am now working on Raptor, Decaf's successor http://code.google.com/p/raptor-chess-interface/ . #

**Decaf version: 1.1.1**

Decaf is a java 1.5 (or better)  chess client for the [free internet chess server](http://www.freechess.org). It runs on linux, windows, and Mac OS X.

Currently the software is in a released state. All known major bugs have been fixed. If you uncover a new bug or would like to request a feature feel free to report an issue in the Issues tab, or participate in the Google Groups link. If you would prefer you can also email me at carsonday@gmail.com or message cday on fics.

Decaf is licensed  under [GNU GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).  All of the chess sets and many of the ideas for Decaf came from the famous windows interface [Thief](http://thief.sourceforge.net) which is under GNU GPL. Many of the chess sets in thief came from other GPL projects.

**Subversion is now up to date. Trunk is currently used for the decaf 2 release. To download the source code for the last official release use the release number in tags.**
