Creating a greeting button 
= Add a button that greets opponents with their handle =
First we need to make an alias.

In the FICS console, enter:

`alias greet say Hello $o!`

($o is a FICS variable that is replaced by your latest opponent's handle)

Next, open _Decaf/properties/PlayingGameToolbar.properties_ in a text editor or word processor.

You will see pairs of numbered text lines. The lines making-up a pair share the same number.

The pairs themselves are numbered sequentially and each pair creates a button on the chessboard toolbar.

The last two lines of the file (in Version 1.3, at least) are:
{{{
6.text=Draw
6.command=draw
}}}
which renders the *Draw* button on the chessboard toolbar.

Add these two lines to create a *Greet* button:
{{{
7.text=Greet
7.command=greet
}}}
Save the file. If Decaf is open, restart it so the changes will take effect.

The new  button appears on the chessboard toolbar when your next game begins.

Just click *Greet* to send a personalized greeting to your opponent.
