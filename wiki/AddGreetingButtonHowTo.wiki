Creating a greeting button 

= Add a button to greet opponents using their handle =

First, we need to make an alias.  In the FICS console, enter:

`alias greet say Hi $o!`

_[$o is a FICS variable that resolves to your present/last opponent's handle.]_

Now open _Decaf/properties/PlayingGameToolbar.properties_ in a text editor or word processor.

You will see pairs of numbered text lines. The lines making-up a pair share the same number.
The pairs themselves are numbered sequentially and each pair creates a button on the chessboard toolbar.

The last two lines of the file (in Version 1.3, at least) are:
{{{
6.text=Draw
6.command=draw
}}}
which renders the *Draw* button on the chessboard toolbar.

Add these two lines of text to create a *Greet* button:
{{{
7.text=Greet
7.command=greet
}}}
Save the file. Restart Decaf if it is open so the changes will take effect.

The new  button will appear on the chessboard's toolbar when your next game begins.
Just click *Greet* to send a personalized greeting to your opponent.
