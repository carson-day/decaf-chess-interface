=How To Build Decaf=

1) Download apache ant.
2) Download speech pack.
3) Download source zip.

Copy all of the files in speech pack/lib into env/freetts/lib from the source zip.

ant dist (Builds decaf and all of the zip files)

ant runosx  (Builds and runs decaf on osx.)

ant runwin  (Builds and runs decaf in generic mode (see build.xml for enabling speech))

ant rungeneric  (Builds and runs decaf on osx (see build.xml for enabling speech and changing timeseals)

ant clean (Cleans up the build directory and properties/preferences.object)


==Why cant it find Decaf.app?==
If you want to build an app for osx keep reading, otherwise just comment out the offending  include in the build.xml file.

In OSX to build the application as an OSX app you need XCode installed. 

First do an ant dist

In finder click on your harddrive.
Run Developer/Applications/Java Tools/Jar Bundler.app

Save the app as Decaf.app in the directory you are using for source.
