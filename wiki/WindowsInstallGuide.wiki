=WINDOWS Installation Instructions=
==Decaf requires java/jre 1.5 or better==

  * If you have no Java or a Java version < 1.5 installed, download and install the latest version of java from suns website (http://www.java.com)
  * Download  the Decaf for Windows Installer and follow the installation instructions. Decaf needs write access to some files, installing it in your "My Documents" folder is a good choice (default setting).

*Alternatively, if the installer does not work for you:*
  * Download the zipped DecafWin ([http://decaf-chess-interface.googlecode.com/files/DecafWin.95.zip here])
  * Download speech pack if you want Speech enabled ([http://decaf-chess-interface.googlecode.com/files/DecafSpeech.zip here])
  * Extract these zip files to where you want them. (they both contain a Decaf base directory and have to be installed into the same directory for Decaf Speech to work) 
  * To run without speech double click on Decaf.jar
  * To run with speech double click on DecafSpeech.jar
