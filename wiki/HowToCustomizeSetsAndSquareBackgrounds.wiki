=How to customize/add Chess Sets and Image Square Backgrounds=

==Chess Sets==
All of the chess sets in decaf have been copied from thief.
Thief uses yellow for the transparent color
red=255 blue=255 green=0. Decaf does also; however, you can also make
the background of the images transparent.

Naming Convention
SET.NAME.WPAWN.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.BPAWN.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.WKNIGHT.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.BKNIGHT.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.WBISHOP.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.BBISHOP.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.WQUEEN.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.BQUEEN.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.WROOK.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.BROOK.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.WKING.SUFFIX
SET.NAME.BKING.SUFFIX

To add a set simply follow the naming convention above replacing name with your unique name and copy the images in the ./Decaf/Resources directory. They dont have to be BMP but it is preferred since images seem to be processed quicker as BMP in java. 

If you come up with a new chess set and would like to contribute it please post in in group discussions or you can email it to me.

==Chess Square Backgrounds==
Two images need to be provided to do square backgrounds. Decaf breaks each image into 64 squares and copys the clips the images into squares.
