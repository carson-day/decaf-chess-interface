===Timeseal Configuration===
   Generic comes with two timeseals for linux: Resources/timeseal_x86 and Resources/timeseal_athlon.
   The timeseal can be configured in properties/Timeseal.properties
   The default is x_86. You can change this properties file to point to the version you need for linux or other os.


===Sound configuration===
   If you are having problems playing or mixing sounds there is a property you can set that will invoke a program via command line to play sounds. In Decaf/properties/os.properties add the line sound.externaprocess=SOUND_PROCESS. Where SOUND_PROCESS is the name of the process to launch.

   Krell wanted to use aoss to mix sounds and added the following line to his os.properties.

{{{
sound.externaprocess=playsound
